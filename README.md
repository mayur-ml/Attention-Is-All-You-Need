# Transformer Implementation

Dive into the heart of modern NLP with this PyTorch-based Transformer implementation. Inspired by ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762), this project showcases a powerful model that leverages self-attention mechanisms to handle sequences efficiently. From token embeddings to multi-head attention and positional encodings, explore how each component works together to capture complex patterns in data. Perfect for those looking to understand and experiment with cutting-edge sequence modeling techniques. Check out the code to see how we bring the revolutionary Transformer architecture to life!
