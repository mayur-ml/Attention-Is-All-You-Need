## Attention Is All You Need (Transformer) Implementation

This repository contains a custom implementation of the Transformer model in PyTorch, inspired by the seminal paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* by Vaswani et al. The Transformer architecture revolutionizes NLP by leveraging self-attention mechanisms, allowing models to capture long-range dependencies and parallelize training. This implementation includes core components such as multi-head self-attention, position-wise feedforward networks, and positional encoding. Designed for clarity and educational purposes, it provides a solid foundation for exploring and extending Transformer-based models.
